## Assumptions
* This is a single-user application and there is no need to consider concurrent access
* THREE cineplexes will be created for the demonstration
* The currency will be in Singapore Dollar (SGD) and inclusive of Good and Services Tax
(GST)
* A simple login for cinema staff is sufficed
* Payment will always be successful
* There is no need to interface with external system, e.g. Payment, printer, etc., but you can
consider it in your design
* Senior citizen can be purchased online without validation of identity or age. The
validation will be done upon entering the cinema
